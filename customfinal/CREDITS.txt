Most of the textures are downloaded from various free stock texture websites like "123rf.com", "textures.com", "polyhaven.com",  "3dtextures.me", "cc0textures.com", "poliigon.com", "artstation.com", or "substance source/share". I just crop/mix/modify them for minecraft texture formats.

Some textures are procedurally/manually made by myself in substance painter.

Some textures are baked from free models downloaded from sketchfab.com or modeled by myself.
